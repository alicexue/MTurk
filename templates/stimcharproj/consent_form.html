		<h4>IRB Protocol #AAAO5907</h4>
		<h4>Principal Investigator: Dr. Daphna Shohamy</h4>
		<h4>Behavioral Studies of Learning, Memory and Decision Making with Food Informed Consent Form</h4>
		<p>We invite you to participate in a research study investigating learning, memory and decision making. In
this study, you will play computer games, answer questionnaires and/or take standardized cognitive tests.</p>
<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
<p>Your participation in this study will remain confidential. However, the following individuals and/or
agencies will be able to look at, copy, use, and share your research information:
<br>
- The investigator, Columbia University Medical Center, and other medical professionals who may be evaluating the study
<br>
- Authorities from Columbia University, including the Institutional Review Board ('IRB')
<br>
- The Federal Office of Human Research Protections ('OHRP')
<br>
Data will be collected, analyzed and stored with an alphanumeric code and never kept with any
information that could be used to identify participants. All documents with identifying information will be
kept separate from study data in a locked file cabinet or password protected electronic files.
Your authorization to use and share the information collected for this research purpose does not have an
expiration (ending) date.
Your Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk) worker ID (i.e., the 14-character sequence of letters and numbers
used to identify workers) will be kept separate from study data in a password protected electronic file.</p>
<h4>Risks and Benefits</h4>
<p>There are no personal benefits to completing this study. However, possible broader benefits may be that
you will contribute to a greater understanding of underlining cognitive processes in learning, memory and
decision making.
There is a risk of loss of private information; this risk always exists, but there are procedures in place to
minimize the risk.</p>
<h4>Compensation</h4>
<p>If you agree to take part in this research study, we will pay you for completion of the task at the posted
rate on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Payment will be given upon verification that the survey was completed
and response accuracy verified. This will occur as soon as possible, dependent upon availability of a
member of our research staff, this may take up to 72 hours for both verification and payment through
Amazon.
Tax law may require the Columbia University Finance Department to report the amount of payment you
receive from Columbia University to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other agencies, as
applicable. Generally, this reporting would take place if you receive payments that equal $600 or more
from Columbia University in a calendar year. You would be responsible for the payment of any tax that
may be due.</p>
<p>You will be paid for your participation at the posted rate. Compensation is contingent upon response completion. You are required to complete at least 90% of the task or the HIT will be rejected and you will not receive compensation. To be specific, we will check if responses were made during the task and ensure that a response was made on at least 90% of trials.</p>
<h4>Contact Information</h4>
<p>Taking part in this study is your choice. You can decide not to take part in or stop being in the study at
any time for any reason (even after you agree to this consent form). However, even if you revoke (take
back) this consent and authorization, the researchers may continue to use and disclose the information
they have already collected.</p>
