	In this part of the experiment, two snacks will be shown on the screen in each trial. One snack will be on the left and the second snack will be on the right. Please determine which snack you prefer more. If you prefer the snack on the left, press key "u". If you prefer the snack on the right, press key "i". You will have 4 seconds to make your choice on each trial, so please try and make your choice quickly. A small black box at the center of the screen will change color momentarily to indicate whether your response is recorded or not. If your response is recorded, the box will turn green. If you do not respond, the box will turn red before moving onto the next trial. If you miss a trial, don't worry, just focus on the next trial.
