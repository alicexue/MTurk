<p>You will now do a computer task about curiosity. In this task, you will be shown a series of trivia questions. For each question, you must decide if you want to know the answer to the question. If you want to find out the answer, you will have to wait a certain amount of time. If you do not want to wait to see the answer, you can choose to skip the question. If you are 100% certain that you already know the answer to the question, you may indicate that you already know it. If you choose to skip or indicate that you know the answer, you will NOT see the answer to the question.<p>

<p>When you are first shown the trivia question, the screen will look like this:<p>

<center><img width="50%" src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'kanga_instructions.png') }}"></center>

<p>You will use the keyboard to indicate if you would like to wait, skip, or know. Press the “Q” key to skip, the “T” key to wait, and the “P” key if you already know the answer to the question.<p>

<p>If you choose to wait for a question, you will be asked to rate if the answer was worth waiting for. Please use the keys for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to indicate how worth it the answer was to you (1 = not worth it, 5 = extremely worth it).<p>

<p>The task will continue for 10 minutes. The task takes the same amount of time regardless of how many questions you choose to skip or wait for, so please base your decisions on how interested you are in learning the answers.<p>

<p>You will now do a short practice version to get comfortable with the task. Please use this time to get used to pressing the different keys and the amount of time you have to respond to the different prompts.<p>
